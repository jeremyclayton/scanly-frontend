Scanly is the optimum product guide for outdoor gear reviewed and compared by you. Discover all outdoor gear specifications and reviews. For this project I paired with emage skate shop in Denver, CO.

You can start by scanning one or more products in the retail store, searching for any product, or just browse all of the avaliable products by category. By simply scanning a barcode you will retrieve all the revelvant information on that particalar item. You can also leave reviews in a easy to use rating system that will upvote or downvote the gear.
